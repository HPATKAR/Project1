# JGB Repricing Framework — DRIVER Project

## Thesis
Japan Bond Market Repricing: JGB Yields Surge on Fiscal and BOJ Policy Shift.
Regime shift from BOJ-suppressed yields to market-driven pricing.

## Objective
Detect structural change early and convert it into tradable strategies across rates, FX, volatility, and global spillovers.

## DRIVER Workflow

1. `/driver:define` — Research what exists, establish the macro thesis and system architecture
2. `/driver:represent-roadmap` — Break into buildable research + trading modules
3. `/driver:implement-screen` — Build data pipelines, models, strategy logic
4. `/driver:validate` — Backtest, validate regime detection, capture evidence
5. `/driver:evolve` — Generate final export package
6. `/driver:reflect` — Capture lessons learned

## Research Lenses
- Yield Curve Dynamics (PCA, term premium, policy expectations)
- Liquidity & Microstructure (basis, vol clustering, long-end instability)
- BOJ Policy Function (reaction function shift, yield suppression decay)
- Structural Change Models (entropy, break tests, Markov/regime-switching)
- Cross-Asset Information Flow (transfer entropy JGBs → FX, global yields)
- FX & Carry Trades (JPY funding stress, rate differentials, vol skew)
- Global Spillovers (USTs, Bunds, EM bonds, duration risk transmission)
- Positioning & Flows (CTA trends, ETF flows, forced unwinds)

## Trade Output Format
Every finding translates into: Rates / FX / Vol / Cross-Asset trades with regime conditions, edge source, and failure scenario.

## Next Step
Run `/driver:define` to begin.
